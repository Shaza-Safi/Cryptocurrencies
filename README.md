# Cryptocurrencies

## Background:
In this project I am helping Martha who is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Analysis Process:
The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. She’ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.

## Challenge Deliverables:

This assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables as follows:

Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA

Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Results:

- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means and finding the Best Value for "k" using an Elbow Curve:
